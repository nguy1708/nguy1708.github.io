### And so it begins...

So, as I begin this journey I looked up what resources is best to learn on. There were two that always came up in every community forum I visited.

* The Odin Project - A free online resource that is very well structured for beginners of all skill levels
* The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl - A book specifically for the ins and outs of Ruby on rails

With these two choices I figured I would be set for a while until I become sufficient enough. I notice a lot of people just jump straight into Ruby on Rails first and learn Ruby as they go. I was a little hesitant following this popular route because Rails is something you add on top of your Ruby skills. Sure, I'm rather familiar with scripting languages and programming itself, but I think it would be better to start with the basics so I can get a good foundation. It may seem faster to just start with Rails, but if my foundation is solid, then it should alleviate any headaches in the future. Or at least...in theory&trade;.
