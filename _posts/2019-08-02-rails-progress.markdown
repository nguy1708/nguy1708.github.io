So lots has happened since the last post and I'm afraid I wasn't able to update this as much as I want. 

Finally dug deeper in to the Rails book by Michael Hartl. The book has been super helpful. Not only is it clear to follow, but the way he writes it allows the user to easily follow along. Not only that, but he really tries to build good practices for the reader early on. An example of this is how he tries to get the reader to regularly push to github and deploy to Heroku just to make sure everything works okay. He goes over test driven development which is good early on for any dev. 

I won't be able to provide a long update on what I've learned so far, but I have managed to get through the first 3 chapters in 1 month. Hopefully my pacing can get a little quicker than that as time goes on.
